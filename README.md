Twinkle
=======

Twinkle is a bootstrapped [Froxlor](http://www.froxlor.org/) Theme for mobile and desktop devices.

Tested with Froxlor > 0.9.30

Twinkle comes with its own jQuery library and own Iconfonts. It uses Google CDN for jQuery but also 
a fallback to Twinkles local JS library.

Theme Features
---------------

- Full responsive for smartphones, phablets, tablets and superlarge screens
- Password strength indicator for all password inputs
- Dashboard is full customizeable, draggable and sortable. Positions will be saved in Local Storage and restored after page reload
- Hosting Package Button for easy setup of webspace, email, ftp, mysql and so on. (Configuration dialog comes soon!)
- APS Free. All APS code has been removed from Twinkle (if you'll find some APS appearances, pls inform me to remove that crap stuff)
- Internet Explorer 6/7/8 free, thanks to jQuery 2.0.3

Please Note!
------------
Twinkle is not for you, if...
- Internet Explorer 6/7 or 8 is your major browser.
- you need APS abilities.

Twinkle is best for you, if...
- you don't care about old browsers.
- want the best user experience for mobile and large desktop devices.
- loves Froxlor, because it's the best of its own.
